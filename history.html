        <h3>History of Poker</h3>
        <p>Although little is known about the invention of Texas hold 'em, the Texas Legislature officially recognizes Robstown, Texas, as the game's birthplace, dating it to the early 20th century.

            After the game spread throughout Texas, hold 'em was introduced to Las Vegas in 1963 at the California Club by Corky McCorquodale. The game became popular and quickly spread to the Golden Nugget, Stardust and Dunes.[3] In 1967, a group of Texan gamblers and card players, including Crandell Addington, Doyle Brunson, and Amarillo Slim were playing in Las Vegas. This is when "ace high" was changed from the original form in which aces were low. Interest in hold 'em outside of Nevada began to grow in the 1980s as well. Although California had legal card rooms offering draw poker, Texas hold 'em was deemed to be prohibited under a statute that made illegal the (now unheard of) game "stud-horse". But in 1988 Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from stud-horse in Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp, and declared to be a game of skill. Today poker is governed by strict rules, both on the Internet and in real casinos, and its tournaments and various competitions have given it a status as an international sporting event.</p>

        <h3>Tournments</h3>
        <p>Like all good sports, tournaments are considered by players to be the best place to test their skills and prove that they are the best. With poker it is no different, there are countless leagues and tournaments around the world (in person and online). Among some, the most in evidence these days are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>WSOP - World Series Of Poker</li>
            <li>WPT - World Poker Tour</li>
            <li>EPT - European Poker Tour</li>
