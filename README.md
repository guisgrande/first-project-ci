## Wireframes and Design

### Wireframes

- The wireframe was created using the Balsamiq tool. The initial idea of comforft image was maintained during the creation of the code, with some adjustments in the layout to visually adapt the page. 
  - The navigation inside the header on the right, I chose to leave it below the title and banner.
  - I decided to put an image on the home page in the about section and not below the questions.
  - I chose not to add images in the tournament section (page 2), to reduce visual information on the page.

### UX/UI Design

#### Site owner goals

- Teaching texas holdem poker to users.
- Explain what the game is about.
- Talk about the origins and major current events.
- Attracting people's interest to learn poker.

#### Colour scheme

- The colors chosen for the composition of the site were a combination of 5 colors (white, black and 3 shades of gray), white used for all text and details, black for the background, and shades of gray for text boxes and section breaks. 
- To highlight the header and footer I used two shades of yellow. 
- Here is an image of the color palette (Coolors).

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/readme-images/colors-template.png" width="650">
</div>

#### Typography

- The fonts were selected from Google Fonts. 
  - For the titles the font chosen was Robot Slab (Regular 400).
  - For the body of the website the font chosen was Roboto Mono (Light 300).
  - The font selected as the second option in case of any loading problems was san-serif.

#### Imagery

- The images selected for the website are intended to complement and assist the content. Each image selected was designed to match the section it was added to.
  - About section image: to create an initial visual impact.
  - Players section images: to portray the mentioned themes.
  - History section images: three different photos to create an overlapping effect. Due to copyrights on old tournament photos and the difficulty in finding good ones, I opted to use photos available on free photo sites.
  - WSOP Last Champions section: video selected to show what a poker tournament looks like.
  - How to play page: the first image shows someone about to make a move and the next two images visually portray what was explained in the texts.

## Features

### Other Tests

- To check accessibility, I did the test using WAVE from WebAIM. The site did not present any errors or alerts.

### Fixed Bugs

- The first bug I fixed was on the home page, where the text was not aligned with the image when doing responsive testing. I was able to fix the problem by changing the positioning code of the image and the text.

### Unfixed Bugs

- I have not identified any bugs to be fixed when finalizing the project. 
  - The only observation is to try to improve the quality of the photos used in the players section of the home page
