## Wireframes and Design

### Wireframes

- The wireframe was created using the Balsamiq tool. The initial idea of comforft image was maintained during the creation of the code, with some adjustments in the layout to visually adapt the page. 
  - The navigation inside the header on the right, I chose to leave it below the title and banner.
  - I decided to put an image on the home page in the about section and not below the questions.
  - I chose not to add images in the tournament section (page 2), to reduce visual information on the page.
