## UX/UI Design

### Strategy

#### Site owner goals

- The website was created to teach texas holdem poker to users.
- The website have the objective of explain what the game is about.
- The website will talk about origins and major current events.
- The website goal is to attract people's interest to learn poker.
- The website should be simple to navigate and easy to read.

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website, so I can know if it's of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site, so I don't lose enthusiasm for using the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to learn something new, so I fulfill the objective that brought me to the site.
- As a user, I want to have access to all the links, so I can connect if it interests me.
- As a user, I want to see media (photos/videos) related to the main subject, so I can better understand what was explained. 

### Scope

- For the Poker Coder website I have planned the following features.
    - Use images, text, and video for more varied content.
    - Use of short texts and longer texts, so the reading doesn't get too tiring.
    - Use technologies and tools that improve site development and performance.

### Structure

- For the Poker Coder website I planned to separate the site into three pages. 
    - The home page, which will be the introduction page of the site, will contain the introduction, questions to arouse interest and talk about the players.
    - The second page will be about the history of poker, with a summary of the origins, the biggest competitions and the last winners of the most important event of the sport.
    - The last page will be about how to play Texas Holdem Poker, with a brief introduction and three more sections: rules, hand rankings, betting, and table positioning.

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

- The wireframe was created using the Balsamiq tool. The initial idea of comfort image was maintained during the creation of the code, with some adjustments in the layout to visually adapt the page. 
  - The navigation inside the header on the right, I chose to leave it below the title and banner.
  - I decided to put an image on the home page in the about section and not below the questions.
  - I chose not to add images in the tournament section (page 2), to reduce visual information on the page.

### Surface

#### Colour scheme

- The colors chosen for the composition of the site were a combination of 5 colors (white, black, and 3 shades of gray), white used for all text and details, black for the background, and shades of gray for text boxes and section breaks. 
- To highlight the header and footer I used two shades of yellow. 
- Here is an image of the color palette used on the website (source: Coolors.io).

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/readme-images/colors-template.png" width="650">
</div>

#### Typography

- The fonts were selected from Google Fonts. 
  - For the titles, the font chosen was Robot Slab (Regular 400).
  - For the body of the website the font chosen was Roboto Mono (Light 300).
  - The font selected as the second option in case of any loading problems was san-serif.

#### Imagery

- The images selected for the website are intended to complement and assist the content. Each image selected was designed to match the section it was added to.
  - About section image: to create an initial visual impact.
  - Players section images: to portray the mentioned themes.
  - History section images: three different photos to create an overlapping effect. Due to copyrights on old tournament photos and the difficulty in finding good ones, I opted to use photos available on free photo sites.
  - WSOP Last Champions section: video selected to show what a poker tournament looks like.
  - How to play page: the first image shows someone about to make a move and the next two images visually portray what was explained in the texts.

## Features

### Fixed Bugs

- The first bug fixed was in the header, where it was not fixing 100% of the width of the page on certain screen sizes, showing a gap between the header and the end of the page. To fix the bug I changed the code for the header CSS style.
   - Changes to fix bugs can be seen here. [Commit](https://github.com/guisgrande/first-project-ci/commit/a2e12e6f4a434de09851ef5cb798bcbe47230186).

- Another bug I fixed was on the home page, where the text was not aligned with the image when doing responsive testing. I was able to fix the problem by changing the positioning code of the image and the text.
   - Changes to fix bugs can be seen here. [Commit](https://github.com/guisgrande/first-project-ci/commit/66a5a0938ac8da5e3d7abd27b09444c6b02eab0a).

### Unfixed Bugs

- I have not identified any bugs to be fixed when finalizing the project. 
  - The only observation is to try to improve the quality of the photos used in the players section of the home page.

## Deployment

- I used the [Code Institute Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template), clicking on the "Use this template" button. From there I created the repository on Github with my username.
- These commands were used for version control during project:
    * git status - to check the status of the files to be commited.
    * git add filename - to add files before committing
    * git commit -m "message" - to commit changes to the local repository

4. Choose "Main" for the branch in the drop down box.
5. Choose "Root" for the directory in the next drop down box.
6. Then click "Save".

### Fork

- Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. Follow this steps:
1. Go to the repository page, can be accessed [here](https://github.com/guisgrande/first-project-ci).
2. On top right, you select the Fork option and proceed.
3. A duplicate will be created inside your repository.

### Clone

- Clone let you create an identical repository to the original. Follow this steps:
1. Go to the repository page, can be accessed [here](https://github.com/guisgrande/first-project-ci).
2. Click on code drop down menu.
3. Choose if you want to clone using HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI. Then select de copy button.
4. Open your Git Bash in your IDE.
5. Type git clone and then paste the URL you copied before.
6. Press Enter to create your clone.
