            <h3>Rules - Texas Holdem</h3>
            <p>The game has some essential rules, to understand how Texas Holdem works.</p>
        <ul>       
            <li>The recommended number of participants is 2-9 people. Each player receives two cards face down and over the course of the betting rounds a total of 5 community cards are added to the table that can be used by everyone. Use your 2 cards with the 5 community cards to form the best 5-card hand (you can use one or two of your cards).</li>
            <li>Each player has a certain initial number of poker chips, and this number is set before the tournament or match. The object of the game is to take all the chips from all the opponents, betting on each hand as they think their chances of winning are good.</li>
            <li>In each round, players who want to continue must either pay the higher bet or fold, if they have already bet they cannot take the chips back if they decide to fold. In case everyone folds the player who placed the last bet wins, if 2 or more players bet until the end, they must reveal their cards and the one with the best hand wins.</li>
            <li>The community cards are revealed in stages, first 3 cards are revealed (called the Flop), then one more (Turn) and the final card (River). Bets are placed before any community cards are turned over (Pre-flop round) and one more betting round after each revelation (Flop, Turn, River), making 4 betting rounds in total. Remember that the betting round only ends when everyone matches the highest bet or folds, so you may have to bet more than once in each betting round.</li>
        </ul>  
            <p>These are the basic rules to start playing, check out the ranking of hands and how the betting dynamics work on the table.</p>

            <h3>Hand Rankings</h3>
            <p>The strength of hands in Texas Holdem, are measured according to the difficulty of the specific combination occurring, with the 5-card combination. Important to know as the strength of hands, is the sequence of cards, with the Aces <b>(A)</b> being the highest followed by the King <b>(K)</b>, Queen <b>(Q)</b>, Jack <b>(J)</b> and the sequence follows from 10 to 2, the last being the lowest card. The following is a list from strongest to weakest hand:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Royal Straight Flush - five cards of the same suit, ranked ace through ten.</li>
            <li>Straight Flush - five cards of the same suit and consecutively ranked.</li>
            <li>Four of a Kind - four cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li>Full House - three cards of the same rank and two more cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li>Flush - any five cards of the same suit.</li>
            <li>Straight - any five cards consecutively ranked.</li>
            <li>Three of a Kind - three cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li>Two Pair - two cards of the same rank and two more cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li>One Pair - two cards of the same rank.</li>
            <li>High Card - five unmatched cards.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>When you and your opponent both show their cards at the end and you have the same hand, for example you both make a flush (5 cards of the same suit) the tie-breaker will be who has the highest card in your hand. Another example is when both have a three of a kind, <em>player 1</em> has <b>K,8</b> and <em>player 2</em> has <b>K,9</b> and on the table we have <b>K,K,3,7,5</b> in which case <em>player 2</em> wins because he has the second highest card <b>9</b> (they this kicker) even though both have the three of K.</p>

        <h3>Bets and positions</h3>
        <p>During the game you must wait your turn to perform your action, the order of play follows from right to left. At the end of the round the button <b>(Dealer)</b> is passed to the player to your left, who determines that he will be the last person to take action in the betting rounds (which gives you an advantage in watching your opponents' behavior). <br>
            The next two players to the left of the Dealer will be the <b>Small Blind</b> and <b>Big Blind</b>, in that order, they must put up the minimum bet amount before everyone else gets their two cards, this is in case everyone folds so that you still have chips in play and so that over time the blinds will start taking your chips if you don't play.Example if set the <b>BB</b> (Big Blind) $100 the <b>SM</b> (Small Blind) puts half $50, some games the blinds go up after certain time.<br>
            The pre-flop round is the only different, because who starts betting after receiving the cards is the player who is to the left of the Big Blind, when they finish betting the next rounds who starts betting is the Small Blind and ends with the Dealer.<br>
            On your turn you must make a decision, Fold, bet (minimum BB amount) or raise (it can be a No Limit game or a common one, or set a limit). Once you have placed a bet and your opponents have increased the bet, you must match it in order to stay in the game; if you decide to fold, you forfeit any chips already placed. And if you are very sure that your hand is the best or that a bluff would be a good play, you can raise on your turn using all your chips (called an <b><em>All-win</b></em>). </p>
