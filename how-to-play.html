        <h3>Rules - Texas Holdem</h3>
        <p>The game has some essential rules, to understand how Texas Holdem works.</p>
        <ul>       
            <li>The recommended number of participants is 2-9 people. Each player receives two cards face down and over the course of the betting rounds a total of 5 community cards are added to the table that can be used by everyone. Use your 2 cards with the 5 community cards to form the best 5-card hand (you can use one or two of your cards).</li>
            <li>Each player has a certain initial number of poker chips, and this number is set before the tournament or match. The object of the game is to take all the chips from all the opponents, betting on each hand as they think their chances of winning are good.</li>
            <li>In each round, players who want to continue must either pay the higher bet or fold, if they have already bet they cannot take the chips back if they decide to fold. In case everyone folds the player who placed the last bet wins, if 2 or more players bet until the end, they must reveal their cards and the one with the best hand wins.</li>
            <li>The community cards are revealed in stages, first 3 cards are revealed (called the Flop), then one more (Turn) and the final card (River). Bets are placed before any community cards are turned over (Pre-flop round) and one more betting round after each revelation (Flop, Turn, River), making 4 betting rounds in total. Remember that the betting round only ends when everyone matches the highest bet or folds, so you may have to bet more than once in each betting round.</li>
        </ul>  
        <p>These are the basic rules to start playing, check out the ranking of hands and how the betting dynamics work on the table.</p>
